## Functionality

By clicking on a pokemon button a modal is being loaded with an image and additional information about the pokemon. The user can also filter the list to search for a pokemon. 

## Usability

By loading external data from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150 the user is able to process the data of a pokemon in a simplified and visually appealing way.

## Technology used

- Html
- Css
- Bootstrap
- Js/Jquery
- Ajax

## Technical Requirements

The pokedex runs on most modern browsers with javascript.
A bare minimum of RAM and processing power should be available for good performance.

## Challenges I faced
 
In the beginning, it was not quite clear which type of JSON object should be fetched and stored, which caused some bugs. They were fixed by adding breakpoints and analyzing the console.
